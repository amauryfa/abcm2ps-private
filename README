			--- abcm2ps version 3.1.x ---

Overview
========

abcm2ps is a program which converts music tunes from ABC format to PostScript.
Based on abc2ps version 1.2.5 (see Contacts below), it was developped mainly to
print barock organ scores which have independant voices played on one or many
keyboards and a pedal-board.


Features
========

The main features of abcm2ps are quite the same as the abc2ps ones and the
file 'features.txt' contains an updated description of these ones.


Installation and usage
======================

The installation procedure is described in the file INSTALL.

Basically, the program usage is:

   abcm2ps [options] file1 [file1_options] file2 [file2_options] ...

where file1, file2, .. are the ABC input files. This will generate
a Postscript file (default name: 'Out.ps' - run 'abcm2ps -h' to
know the list of the command line options).


Documentation
=============

- abc-draft.txt is the ABC draft on which abcm2ps is developped.
- options.txt contains the list of the command line options.
- format.txt contains the list of the format parameters.
- features.txt lists some differences from, and extensions to
  the ABC standard.


Differences with abc2ps
=======================

- the algorithms relative to voice and staff handling are different and may
  give better or worse results depending on the tunes.
- abcm2ps does not print the list of tunes and has different filtering
  functions. On the command line:
	- '-o' is implicit
	- '-e' accepts only one parameter.
	- '-C', '-R', '-S', '-T' don't exist anymore. If you want such
	  filtering, you should to use some external script or program instead.
- abcm2ps has no interactive mode ('-i' - did anybody use it?).


Limits
======

Many limits may be changed at compilation time (number of voices, staves, ..).
The current version does not handle correctly more than 2 voices per staff.
