		--- abcm2ps version 8.x.x ---

Overview
========

abcm2ps is a program which converts music tunes from ABC format to
PostScript or SVG. Based on abc2ps version 1.2.5 (see Contacts below),
it was developped mainly to print barock organ scores which have
independant voices played on one or many keyboards and a pedal-board
(the 'm' of abcm2ps stands for many or multi staves/voices).


Features
========

The main features of abcm2ps are quite the same as the abc2ps ones,
but they are closer to the ABC standard 2.1.1 (February 2013):

Installation and usage
======================

The installation procedure is described in the file INSTALL.

Basically, the program usage is:

   abcm2ps [options] file1 [file1_options] file2 [file2_options] ...

where file1, file2, .. are the ABC input files. This will generate
a Postscript file (default name: 'Out.ps' - run 'abcm2ps -h' to
know the list of the command line options).


Documentation
=============

- options.txt contains the list of the command line options.

- the format parameters are described in:

- the differences from the current ABC standard are described in:

Limits
======

Many limits may be changed at compilation time (number of voices,
staves, ..).
