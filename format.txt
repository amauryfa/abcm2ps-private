			Format parameters
			=================

The general layout of the printed scores may be changed in four ways:
	1- at compilation time setting the values in abc2ps.h,
	2- at running time in a 'format' file,
	3- at startup time in the command line,
	4- by pseudo-comments inside the tunes.

For more about 3), have a look at options.txt.

A format file contains lines giving the parameters values, format:

	parameter [parameter list]

In a format file, empty lines and lines starting with '%' are ignored.

The pseudo-comments used for formatting have the format:

	%%parameter [parameter list]

Format parameters may appear in the command line as:

	--parameter [parameter list]

The keyword "lock" may appear at the end of the parameter list, in
which case, the parameter will not be settable anymore (except with
"lock" again). It is implicitly added in the command line parameters.

Some pseudo-comments are treated while being parsed and cannot appear
in a format file nor in the command line. These ones are listed at the
end of this file.

In font definitions, <font>, <encoding> and <size> may be specified
as '*' (star), in which case the font, encoding or size remains
the same. When the <encoding> is omitted, it defaults to 'utf-8'
or to the last 'font' definition of the same font. The <encoding> values
are described in 'annotationfont'.


List of the format parameters
-----------------------------

  abc2pscompat <bool>
	Default: 0
	Compilation: none
	Command line: -u
	Description:
		When true, set 'M' as the !tenuto! decoration and do a
		pitch translation for the bass and alto clefs.

  alignbars <int>
	Default: 0
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		Align the bars of the next <int> music lines.
		Such an alignment works only when there is only one
		voice in each music line (no V:, %%staves or %%score
		is allowed).

  aligncomposer <int>
	Default: 1
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		Tell where to display the composer field.
		A negative value means 'on the left', 0 means 'center',
		and a positive value means 'on the right'.
			

  annotationfont <font> [<encoding>] [<size>]
	Default: Helvetica 12
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		Set the annotation font to <font> with a size <size>.
		When present, <encoding> may be either 'us-ascii', 'utf-8'
		or 'native'. It is used only for PostScript output without
		pango. When the <encoding> is not 'native', a PostScript
		convertion table is build to handle most latin characters.
		It may be extended to handle more characters, but a good
		PostScript knowledge is required (see the file sample.abc).

  autoclef <bool>
	Default: 1
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		When true, set the clefs and possibly insert clef
		changes when no clef is defined in K: or V:.

  barnumbers <int>
	Same as 'measurenb'.

  barsperstaff <int>
	Default: 0
	Compilation: none
	Command line: -B<int>
	Description:
		Try to typeset with <int> bars on each line.

  breaklimit <float>
	Default: 0.7

		cannot occur.
		<float> must be between 0.5 (line breaks can occur in the right
		half line) and 1 (split at the exact calculated point).
		This parameter may be used with 'maxshrink' to adjust the
		automatic line breaks.

  breakoneoln <bool>
	Default: 1
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		When set, on finding an end of line (eoln), do as if
		a space was set before the next note or rest.

		Each line between 'beginps' and 'endps' is included in
		the PostScript output file.
		Such a sequence cannot be greater than 128 Kb.
		When the output file format is SVG (command options '-g',
		'-v' or '-X'), the PostScript code is executed by the
		small abcm2ps PS interpreter. Sequences which cannot
		be executed (as font redefinitions) must be skipped
		checking the presence of the symbol 'svg':

		/svg where {pop} {
		.. PostScript code which cannot be executed by abcm2ps ..
		} ifelse

		after the first K: information field).

  bgcolor <color>
	Default: none
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		Define the background color of SVG images.
		This parameter is used only when the output is pure SVG
		(options '-g' and '-v').

		Decorations which names begin with 'head-' prevent the
		note head(s) to be drawn.

  decoration <character>
	Default: !
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:

		of the V: information field.

  encoding <charset encoding> | <int>
	Default: 0
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:

  flatbeams <bool>
	Default: 0
	Compilation: none
	Command line: -f

  font <font> [[<encoding>] <scale>]
	Default: none
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		Define a font and its encoding.
		This parameter is required with PostScript output when
		specific fonts are defined later in ABC files/tunes.
		It must be defined before any PostScript output is done,
		generally in a format file.

		When absent, <encoding> defaults to the current
		'encoding' parameter (see above).

		<scale> is the width factor to apply to the Time-Roman
		character width. It is needed to adjust the string width
		in case the computation with the default scale gives
		erroneous values (if string clash, set <scale> lower than 1.0
		- if too much space, set it greater than 1.0).
		Note that the <scale> is not applied immediately: it is
		applied only on particular font assignment.

  footer <text>
	Default: none
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		Define the text printed at the bottom of each page.
		There may be one or two lines. When 2 lines, these
		ones must be separated by the 2 characters "\n" (not
		a real 'newline').
		In each lines 3 areas may be defined: left, center and
		right.
		These areas are separated by tabulations (real TABs,
		not "\t") and may be empty (if the left area is empty,
		double quote the string - see sample3.abc for example).
		The character '$' introduces variable expansion:
			- '$d' is the date and time of the last modification
			   of the current ABC input file,
			- '$D' is the current date and time,
			- '$F' is the current input file name,
			- '$Ix' is any header information type ('x' is a
			   letter range 'A' to 'Z').
			- '$P' is the current page number,
			- '$P0' and '$P1' are also the page number, but only
			   when this one is even ('0') or odd ('1'),
			- '$T' is the current tune title,
			- '$V' is 'abcm2ps-' followed by the program version.
		For example, the command line option '-N3' is the same
		as:
			%%header "$P0		$P1"
		(note the 2 TABs).
		If the footer (or header) begins with '-' (hyphen/minus),
		it is not printed on the first page.

  footerfont <font> [<encoding>] [<size>]

		The format is a set of letters, numbers, commas and
		plus and minus signs. Unrecognized characters are ignored.

		A letter gives the ABC header information type. It may be any
		type range 'A' to 'Z', but 'I', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'U' and 'V'.

		Alignment is defined by a number and/or a minus sign
		following the letter. It may be:
			'0' for 'center',
			'1' for 'right align'
			'-1' (or '-') for 'left align'.
		When absent, alignment defaults to center ('0').

		A plus sign ('+') may appear between two fields
		in which case these fields are concatenated (this works
		only with fields of the same type and same alignment).

		A comma defines a box edge. In each box, the fields are
		vertically added in their alignment zones.

		Example:
			%%titleformat R-1 P-1 Q-1 T C1 O1 , T + T N1
		displays:
		- in the 1st box:
		    - on the left: the rhythm, part and tempo
		    - in the middle: the main title (only)
		    - on the right: the composer and origin
		- in the 2nd box:

List of the pseudo-comments treated while parsed
------------------------------------------------

  abcm2ps <char>
	Change the pseudo-comment prefix.
	By default, pseudo-comments are line starting with two percent
	signs ("%%"). This command redefines the second character of
	these commands. This permits to avoid clashes with pseudo-comments
	of other programs.
	Example:

		%%abcm2ps *
		%*voice Mib		% the voices which name contains "Mib"
		%*transpose -3		% are transposed a minor third lower
		%*abcm2ps %		% restore standard pseudo-comments

  begintext [<option>]
	Start printing a free text.
	The text appears on the next lines. When a line starts
	with '%%', these characters are removed.
	The text ends on a line containing
		%%endtext
	<option> may be:
	    'obeylines':	  keep lines as they are (default)
	    'align' or 'justify': justify the lines
	    'ragged' or 'fill':	  fill the lines
	    'center':		  center the lines
	    'skip':		  don't print the lines (same as comments)
	    'right':		  align at the right side
	When <option> is omitted, it defaults to the %%textoption value.
	Inside the free text, an empty line starts a new paragraph.
	Page breaks (start of new pages) cannot occur in the middle of
	a paragraph.

  center <line of text>
	Print one line of centered text.

  clef <clef_name><clef_octave><clef_line><octave_indication>
	Insert a new clef.
	<clef_name> may be:
		treble (same as G2)
		alto (same as C3)
		tenor (same as C4)
		bass (same as F,4)
		perc (same as P2)
		g (same as G')
		G
		c (same as C')
		C
		f (same as F')
		F
		P
		"<user_clef_name>"
	(<user_clef_name> is the name of a PostScript function which
	 draws the clef glyph)
	<clef_octave> gives the octave of the note of the clef. It has the
	same syntax as normal notes, i.e.:
		' (quote) one octave higher
		, (comma) one octave lower
	<clef_line> gives the number of the line on which the note of the
	clef is defined.
	<octave_indication> is either +8 or -8, in which case a '8' is drawn
	above or below the clef. Note that this indication does not do any
	octave transposition as in the standard K:/V: fields.

	Only the clef name is mandatory.
	There should be no space between the %%clef parameters.
	Examples:
		%%clef bass''	% abc2ps behaviour
		%%clef G,-8	% clef for tenor voice

  EPS <eps_file>
	Include the file <eps_file>.
	The file content is left or right aligned or centered according
	to the current value of '%%textoption'.

  endtext
	See 'begintext'.

  multicol <command>
	Define multicolomn printing.
	<command> may be:
	    'start':	save the current vertical position and the left
			and right margins. Then, these margins may
			be changed to print music or text.
	    'new':	reset the vertical offset at the place of the
			previous '%%multicol start', and restore the left
			and right margins.
	    'end':	restore the left and right margins, and skip down
			to a safe place.
	(see 'sample3.abc' for example).
	This command may also be used to group some tunes and text in a
	same page.

  newpage [<int>]
	Continue printing on a new page and optionally restart page
	numbering from <int>.

  repbra <bool>
	The repeat brackets are normally displayed as they are found in
	a voice. %%repbra 0' prevents displaying them for the current voice.

  repeat [<n> [k]]
	Try to replace a sequence by one or many repeat signs.
	When placed after a bar, <n> indicates the number of measures
	to be repeated. It may be only one or two. If <n> is one,
	<k> indicates how many times the previous measure is to be
	repeated. If <n> is two, <k> is not used.
	When placed after a note or rest, <n> indicates the number of
	notes and rests to be repeated, and <k> how many times this
	repetition occurs.
	When omitted, <n> and <k> default to 1.
	No check is done on the equality of the sequences.
	See 'sample5.abc' for examples.

  score <definition>
	See the ABC standard version 2.1 for description.

  sep [<h1> <h2> <len>]
	Print a separator (centered line) of length <len> with
	space <h1> above and space <h2> below (defaults: h1 = h2 = 0.5cm,
	len = 3.0cm).

  setbarnb <int>
	Set the number of the next measure to <int>.
	When found outside a tune, this command is the same as
	'%%measurefirst'. If it appears at the beginning of the tune
	(after K:), only the 2nd measure will have the new number.

  staff <["+" | "-"] int>
	Put the next symbols of the current voice on the staff <int>
	(1..n - see sample4.abc for example), or on the <+int>th or
	<-int>th staff.

  staffbreak <unit> ["f"]
	Have a break in the current staff. <unit> gives the width of the
	break (in points, inches or cm). As a side effect, when the width
	is bigger than 0.5 cm, the left side of the staff system is redrawn.
	When used in a multi-voice tune, a staff break must be inserted
	in each voice.
	When "f" is not present, the staff break is removed if it occurs
	at start or end of line.

  staves <definition>
	See 'features.txt' for description.

  tablature [#<int>] [pitch=<pitch>] [[<unit-1>] <unit-2>] <unit-3> \
			<head-func> <note-func> [<bar-func>]
	Define a tablature for the current voice.

	Arguments:
		<int> gives the tablature number (from 1 to 8, default=1).
		<pitch> is the pitch of the instrument. It looks like
			a normal ABC note. When present, the pitch of
			each note is given to the note function.
			When absent, the information about the note(s)
			is given by one or many lyrics (w:).
		<unit-1> gives the width of the header (left side of
			the music line).
		<unit-2> gives the tablature height above the staff.
		<unit-3> gives the tablature height under the staff.
		<head-func> is the PostScript function called at start
			of a new music line.
		<note-func> is the PostScript function called at each note.
		<bar-func> is the PostScript function called at each bar.

	The arguments of the PostScript functions depend on the pitch
	presence.
	When the pitch is absent, the stack contains:
		- head function:
			- the music line width,
			- the x and y offsets,
			- the number of w: lines.
		- note function:
			- the string as defined by the 'w:' line.
			- the x and y offsets.
			- the w: line number (0 .. n-1).
		- bar function:
			- the ABC bar as a string.
			- the x and y offsets.
			- the w: line number (0 .. n-1).
	Otherwise (pitch present), the PS origins are translated to
	the tablature area and the stack contains:
		- head function:
			- the instrument pitch with a single uppercase
			  letter and a sharp or flat.
		- note function:
			- the octave (0 is 'C') letting pitch >= 0 and < 36
			- the pitch in 12th of octave on 3 octaves (0..35 -
				not integer when microtone)
			- the x offset
		- the bar function is never called.

	For examples of tablatures without pitch, see:
		'accordion.abc'
		'http://moinejf.free.fr/abc/banjo.abc',
		'http://moinejf.free.fr/abc/bataille.abc'
		'http://moinejf.free.fr/abc/tabyf1.abc'
	For examples of tablatures with pitch, look at
		flute.fmt
	and try:
		abcm2ps sample.abc -e1 -F flute.fmt -T1 -T3

  text <line of text>
	Print one line of text with the current value of '%%textoption'.

  transpose <int> [ "#" | "b" ]
	Transpose the music.
	<int> is a signed number of semitones.
	When "#" or "b" is present, the new key signature(s) will have
	sharps or flats in case of enharmonic keys.
	When this command appears in a global definition (format file or
	file header), it applies to all voices of all the following tunes.
	When it appears in a tune header, it applies to all voices.
	When inside a tune body, it applies to the current voice only.
	It may be delayed by %%tune or %%voice in which case it applies to
	the selected tune(s) and/or voice(s).
	Note 1: The name of the latin guitar chords is not transposed.
	Note 2: Transposition of key signatures with explicit or
	added accidental list does not work.
	Note 3: The transposition is always absolute (it does not depend
	on a previous %%transpose command).

  vskip <unit>
	Skip vertical space of height <unit>.


Pseudo-commands used for external formatting
--------------------------------------------

  break <symbol selection> [ [ "," | " " ] <symbol selection> ]*
	Insert a music line break after the selected symbol(s).

	This command may appear only a %%tune sequence.
	There may be many %%break commands in a %%tune sequence.

  clip [ <start symbol> ]  "-" [ <end symbol> ]
	Define the subset of the tune(s) to be printed.

	<start symbol> and <end symbol> are <symbol selection>s (see below).
	The starting and ending symbols are included in the clip.
	This command may appear only a %%tune sequence.
	There may be only one %%clip command in a %%tune sequence.

  select [ <tune index list> ] [ <regular expression> ]
	Select a subset of tunes of an ABC file to be printed.

	<tune index list> is a comma separated list of tune numbers.
	Each selector applies to the current ABC file.
	A tune number may be:
	- a single index value as indicated in the 'X:' field,
	- a range of such values.
	  A range is indicated as <first_index> "-" [ <last_index> ].
	  The last index may be omitted meaning 'last tune of file'.
	The <regular expression> applies to the tune headers on their whole.
	An empty %%select selects all the tunes of the next ABC files.

	Command line examples:
		abcm2ps voices -e 1,3-5 newfeatures -e5-
		abcm2ps sample2 -eclefs voices -e 'K:C\s'

	ABC file example:
		%%select C:.*Bach
		%%abc-include voices.abc
		%%abc-include sample5.abc

	Note: Such elections may give strange results when there are global
	definitions in the ABC files (before and between the tunes).

  tune [ <regular expression> ]
	Select the tune(s) to which the following options will be applied.

	The options are pseudo-comments (starting with %%), up to an other
	'%%tune' command. The command "%%tune end" may be used to mark the
	end of the options.

	They are inserted at start of the tune(s) (after the first K:).
	which header matches the <regular expression>.
	When an option is %%score or %%staves, it replaces a %%score or
	%%staves of the tune. There may be many such options, each one
	replacing one %%staves/score of the tune.
	This command may appear only in a global definition (command line,
	format file or file header).
	When <regular expression> is the same as the one of a previous %%tune,
	all the previous tune options for this regular expression are removed.
	When <regular expression> is absent, all the tune options of all tunes
	are removed.
	ABC file example:
	  Remove the 'ossia' part from sample5.abc of the abcm2ps package

		%%tune Bach
		%%leftmargin 1cm lock
		%%rightmargin 1cm lock
		%%scale 0.7
		%%staves {(1 2) (3 4)}
		%%staves {(1 2) (3 4)}
		%%staves {(1 2) (3 4)}
		%%abc-include sample5.abc

  voice [ <regular expression> ]
	Select the voice(s) to which the following options will be applied.

	The options are pseudo-comments (starting with %%), up to an other
	'%%voice' or '%%tune' command. The command "%%voice end" may be used
	to mark the end of the options for the last voice.
	They are inserted before the first symbol of each voice which
	identifiers or full names match the <regular expression>.
	This command may appear only in a global definition (command line,
	format file,r file header or %%tune option list).
	When <regular expression> is the same as the one of a previous %%voice,
	all the previous voice options for this regular expression are removed.
	When <regular expression> is absent, all the global or tune related
	voice options are removed.
	ABC file example:
	  Print 'Tridal a ra va c'halon' with 4 staves, lyrics at the top
	  and with a 'tenor' clef.

		%%select Tridal
		%%tune Tridal
		%%staves S A T B
		%%voice S
		%%vocal up
		%%voice T
		%%clef G,-8
		%%abc-include voices.abc

  <symbol selection>
	The <symbol selection> used in %%break and %%clip permits to identify
	a music symbol (note, rest or bar - only).
	It has the following format:

		<measure number> [ ":" <time numerator> "/" <time denominator> ]

	<measure_number> is the measure number as it is displayed with
	"%%measurenb 1"	or '-j1'.
	Note that this number may change when changing the %%contbarnb value.
	In case %%contbarnb is not set, the repeat sequences may be identified
	by a letter after the measure number as "10b" (second repeat sequence).

	<time numerator> and <time denominator> define the fraction of a whole
	note which gives the time offset of the symbol from the selected
	measure.
	The numerator is numbered starting from 0. The value 0 selects
	the measure bar. To select the first note of a measure, set the
	fraction to a small value as "5:1/64".

	When the time fraction is ommited, the measure bar is selected.

  <regular expression>
	  Such expressions are a subset of Perl regular expressions:
		^	match beginning of the string
		$	match end of the string
		|	start an alternate sequence
		()	grouping
		.	match any character
		[...]	match any character from set
		[^...]	match any character but ones from set
		\s	match whitespace
		\S	match non-whitespace
		\d	match decimal digit
		+	match one or more times
		*	match zero or more times
		?	match zero or once
		\xDD	match byte with hex value 0xDD
		\meta	match one of the meta character: ^$().[*+?\

  Examples:
	- transpose up by two semitones all the voices which names contain
	  the characters "Bb":

		abcm2ps tune1.abc --voice Bb --transpose 2

	- display only the 2 first measures of the tunes which titles start
	  with "Gloria":

		abcm2ps tune2.abc --tune '^Gloria' --clip -3

	  (note: "-3" means "include the bar starting the measure 3")
