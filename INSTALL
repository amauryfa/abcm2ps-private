		--- abcm2ps installation ---


Unix(-like) systems.
===================

This version uses the GNU 'autoconf' package, so, after untarring the
sources, run:

	./configure
	make

and then, as root, do:

	make install

The 'abcm2ps' command should work if '/usr/local/bin' is in your path
(try 'abcm2ps -h' for a list of the command line options).

You may change many compile options at configure level. To know which,
run:

	configure --help


Windows or MAC systems.
======================

Change the file 'config.h' according to your preferences, compile all
the '.c' files using an ANSI C compiler, and link them together. The
resulting binary file should run immediately from where it has been
generated. You may then move at any place you want.


Testing.
=======

To test the program, run it with one of the .abc files as the command
line argument:

	abcm2ps sample

The resulting file, 'Out.ps', may be displayed using a PostScript
previewer such as ghostview, or may be sent directly to a PostScript
printer, or indirectly to a simple printer using a postscript filter.
