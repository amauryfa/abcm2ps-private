The list of the command line options may be know running
	'abcm2ps -h'

List of the options
-------------------

  -a<float>
	See: format - maxshrink <float>

  -B<int>, +B
	See: format - barsperstaff <int>

  -b<int>
	See: format - measurefirst <int>

  -c, +c
	See: format - continueall <bool>

  -D<dir>
	Search the format files in the directory <dir>.

  -d<unit>
	See: format - staffsep <unit>

  -E, +E
	Produce EPSF output instead of simple PS.
	In this mode, each tune goes to a different file. The
	names are '<name>nnn.eps' (see '-O' for <name>) where
	'nnn' is the tune sequence number.

  -e<list>
	Select the tunes inside an ABC file.
	<list> is a comma separated list of items (tune numbers).
	Each selector applies to the previous associated ABC file.
	An item may be a single index value (as indicated in the 'X:'
	field), or a range of such values. A range is indicated as
	<first_index>-<last_index>. The last index may be omitted
	meaning 'end of file'.
	Example:
		abcm2ps voices -e 5,2-4 newfeatures -e5-
	Note: Filtering may raise problems, mainly on global definitions.

  -F<file>, +F
	Read format file <file>.fmt

  -f
	See: format - flatbeams <bool>

  -G, +G
	See: format - graceslurs <bool>

  -H
	Display the current format values.

  -h
	Quick help, equivalent to "abc2ps" without any arguments.
	This also shows the default settings for some parameters.

  -I<unit>
	See: format - indent <unit>

  -j<int>[b], +j
	See: format - measurenb <int>

  -k<int>[b], +k
	See: format - measurenb <int>

  -L<int>
	See: format - encoding <int>

  -l, +l
	See: format - landscape <bool>

  -M, +M
	See: format - musiconly <bool>

  -m<unit>

  -N, +N
	Number the pages.

  -n, +n
	See: format - writehistory <bool>

  -O<name>, +O
	Define the output file name.
	By default, the output file name is 'Out.ps' for PS, and
	'Outnnn.eps' for EPSF (see option '-E' for the Postscript
	mode).
	With this option, it will be <name>.ps or <name>nnn.eps.
	If <name> is '=', the output file as the name of the ABC
	source file with the extension '.ps' (or '.eps').

  -p, +p
	Select the secundary pretty output option. See '-p'.

  -p
	Generate pretty output, with more whitespace between tunes,
	larger fonts for titles, and larger music symbols. By default, 
	the layout squeezes the tunes to reduce the number of pages.

  -s<float>
	See: format - scale <float>

  -u
	Select the abc2ps implicit decorations.

  -v<int>
	Set the verbosity for output to the screen to <int>.
	Hereby -v0 gives very little, -v1,v2,v3.. show successively 
	more information. Verbosity >= 10 is for debugging.
	This option works only when abcm2ps is compiled with the
	-DDEBUG option.

  -V
	Show the version number.

  -w<unit>
	See: format - staffwidth <unit>

  -x, +x
